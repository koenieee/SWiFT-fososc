<h1 align="center">SWiFT Fluency Game</h1>
<p>Welcome to the SWiFTgame!</p>
<h2 class="western">How to play?</h2>
<i>Who can talk with the computer most fluently???</i><br/><br/>
<p>The game lets you translate a text in English into a
form that is transparent to computers, and checks whether it can
derive the same things from your translation as from the original
text. If that is the case then your translation must have been pretty
good! Moreover, the quicker you did this, the more points you gain.
Fluency = speed + correctness. Thus, the higher your fluency in
speaking computationally transparent, the higher your score!</p>
<p>The game proceeds in the following rounds:</p>
<p style="text-indent:0em"><b>Translation round</b>: a sentence or text in English is given
(the source text). Translate it as swiftly and correctly as you can
into the computationally transparent form.</p>
<p style="text-indent:0em"><b>Bridge construction round</b>: the computer asks for additional
information to establish how to connect the words in your
translation to concepts that are expressed in the English text. It
needs this in the background for the rounds to come.</p>
<p style="text-indent:0em"><b>Question attack round</b>: the computer will now attack your
translation by posing questions that have a very specific answer
based on the English source text. The game then presents the answer as it should be based on the English source text, and asks whether you agree that it is correct, and, moreover, that it is the only correct one. [Note: the check is currently disabled.]</p>
<p style="text-indent:0em"><b>Algorithmic defence round</b>: the computer now constructs a
program, purely based on information in the question, which is going
to derive the answer to the question according to your translation.</p>
<p style="text-indent:0em"><b>Conclusion</b>: you'll see whether what was derived from your
text and that from the English source text are the same, or not! If
they are, you gain points, which keeps into account the speed with which you made the translation [The latter not yet realised in this version]. If they are not, don't. Try to
investigate closely what you did wrong and do better next time!</p>

The game cannot be played sensibly without first selecting and studying a constitution, which, among other things explains <i>Folminqua</i>, the computationally transparent language in which you have to write your translation. When you start playing for the first time, you will be automatically prompted to do this.

<h2 class="western">Game with a purpose</h2>
<p><i>The purpose of the SwiFT game is to learn to speak
computationally transparent.</i></p><br />
<p>SWiFT is a game, but it is even more than that. If you are interested you can read on, if not, and just want to enjoy the challenge of the game you can easily skip this part.</p>
<p>Information can be written down in such a form, that computers can
help people to draw quite reliable conclusions from information much
quicker. Computers could help to such an extent, that it would, well, take forever
to come to many conclusions without their help. This game challenges
you to develop fluency in writing this way. In a sense, the game helps fostering a new type of computationally transparent literacy.</p>
<p>We are not speaking about programming languages here. Nope... It
is about languages to represent <i>any</i> information that can be represented symbolically, "such as the sun is a
sphere", "tomorrow it is going to snow in Antananarivo" or
"Arcadi Volodos is going to give a concierto in the concertgebouw
in Amsterdam", "The sun is approximately a spherical form", or
more complicated "I'm almost certain that there are at least 2 times as
many books about that subject in our library, as Pete borrowed from
the library yesterday."</p>
<p>SWiFT tests and trains your fluency in speaking such languages.
The first version of this game is quite simple, we take baby steps at
a time of course. If you were to learn Mandarin, you wouldn't start
as an interpreter between the presidents of China and the US, would you?
Probably things would end up quite badly with the world...</p>
