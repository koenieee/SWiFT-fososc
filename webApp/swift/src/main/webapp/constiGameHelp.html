<h1>SWiFT ConstiGames</h1>

<i>"May <b>your</b> force be with the constitution-beings"</i><br/><br/>

<p>With playing ConstiGames (Constitutional Evolution Games) you can contribute to better strategies to play the fluency game. Such a strategy is called a <b>constitution</b> because you can regard it as a written account of the inner workings of the fluency-skill. Your constitution will be automatically offered to <b>new</b> players to learn to play the game. In the game, you are free to create new constitutions to compete with the existing ones or improve existing ones. Follow and modify the constitution(s) you collaborate in to improve its success, and make it better than any of the other constitutions in the population.</p>

<p>Each constitution's success is expressed in a fitness score, which is equal to the average fluency of players who used it to learn to play the game. The higher the fitness, the more likely new fluency-players will use it to learn to play the game, and the more likely it is that ConstiGame players will put effort in it to improve it even further. In this way a constitution with a high fitness is more likely to receive more resources for its further evolution, somewhat similar to biological evolution.</p>

<p>Each constitution in this game, can as such be regarded as a being in its own right. And ConstiGame players are nothing less than the "life giving" force behind each of them!</p>

<!-- TODO  Isn't that a cool idea.... The crowd of people "flowing" through a constitution are what it-->
